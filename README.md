# CryptoMessenger-beta-v1.0
Beginner level Python program for Linux to make communication little more secure.

It was my first ever Python program. I recently stumbled upon it, and decided to compile it for Linux platform. It works through the Gmail servers, and uses a very simple encryption algorithm of sorts.
It is nothing high-end, nor is it a finished project. Its merely an idea. An idea of a free and secure digital world I imagined quite a long time ago.
And it is by your efforts that we can pull of this idea and shape it into reality. Lets work towards a world where privacy is valued.

HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM?
      Create a new Gmail account and go into its settings to allow less-secure apps to access it. Also enable the IMAP/SMTP access if there is one.
Next, to open the program, open terminal in the directory where you downloaded the programs file. Now type './ CryptoMessenger_beta-v1.0'.
From there on, the program is self explanotory. Type 'START' to start the program. Type 'HELP' to see the help menu. Type 'EXIT' to exit the program.
Once you type 'Start' to start the program, you will be asked to login to your account. Next up, you will be presented with the option to 'Send' OR 'Receive' message. Remember the input dialogue is case sensitive. So, you will have to exactly enter 'Send' or 'Receive'.

The sent message is converted to and broken into two things, Extractor Factor and Number of Neutrino's. When receiving a message, you will be displayed the Subject of the message, the Extractor Factor and the No. of Neutrino's. You will be asked to enter them in the input dialogues below. After doing so, the original message will be displayed to you.
